---

A real-time market analysis dashboard that combines technical price indicators, multi-source news sentiment, and event-driven signal generation into a single composite score for 24 tracked assets across commodities, cryptocurrencies, technology equities, and market indices.

All data is sourced from free, publicly available feeds. No proprietary APIs, no paid data subscriptions, and no trading execution. The platform is an analytical tool only.

## Overview

The platform processes data from two independent sources on each analysis cycle:

- **Price data** — 30-day OHLCV history fetched from Yahoo Finance via `yfinance`
- **News data** — up to 300 articles ingested in parallel from 12 curated RSS feeds, deduplicated using Jaccard similarity, and scored using VADER sentiment analysis augmented with a financial lexicon

These two streams are merged into a composite signal score ranging from -10 (Strong Bearish) to +10 (Strong Bullish) using weighted contributions from six sub-components: trend direction, price momentum, RSI oscillator reading, news sentiment, trend strength, and market/sector context. Each asset class applies its own weighting profile to reflect how different market types respond to different signal types.

Historical snapshots are persisted to compressed JSON files on disk. A background scan thread processes all 24 assets every 30 minutes without blocking the dashboard UI.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/The-Pulse-Engine/Pulse-Engine_Market_Intelligence_Platform.git
cd Pulse-Engine_Market_Intelligence_Platform

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
# Python 3.11–3.14 are all supported
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: install developer tooling for tests and linting
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# 4. Run the dashboard
streamlit run dashboard/main.py
```

The dashboard opens at `http://localhost:8501`. A full-market background scan starts automatically on first load and repeats every 30 minutes.

---

## Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
docker build -t market-intel .
docker run -p 8501:8501 market-intel
```

Dashboard available at `http://localhost:8501`.

---

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.11–3.14 (all supported; `pip install -r requirements.txt` works out of the box on all four versions)
- Internet connection (Yahoo Finance and RSS feeds)

### Dependencies

| Package | Minimum Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| streamlit | 1.54.0 | Dashboard framework |
| yfinance | 1.2.1 | Price history via Yahoo Finance |
| pandas | 2.3.3 | DataFrame operations |
| plotly | 6.6.0 | Interactive charts and heatmap |
| feedparser | 6.0.12 | RSS feed ingestion |
| vaderSentiment | 3.3.2 | Sentiment analysis |

Install the pinned runtime dependencies first:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For development, linting, and testing tools, install:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

---

## Running the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/main.py
```

On startup the dashboard:

1. Renders the sidebar with category and asset selectors
2. Checks whether a full-market scan is due
3. Launches a background daemon thread to scan all 24 assets if the last scan summary is missing or older than 30 minutes
4. Displays `System initializing — full market scan running in background...` while the scan is active
5. Fetches price and news data for the currently selected asset and renders the full analysis panel

The sidebar shows the scan status (running / N minutes ago / pending first run) and a manual `Run full scan now` button.

---

## Running a Full Scan

The scan pipeline can be executed independently of the dashboard:

```bash
# Full verbose scan — saves snapshots and summary
python app/scan.py

# Suppress per-asset log lines
python app/scan.py --quiet

# Validate pipeline without writing any files
python app/scan.py --dry-run
```

Output is written to:
- `market_data/<AssetName>_YYYYMMDD.json.gz` — per-asset daily snapshot
- `market_data/_scan_summary.json.gz` — hierarchical summary of latest scan

---

## Configuration

All tunable values are in `config/settings.py`. No magic numbers exist anywhere else in the codebase.

| Constant | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LOOKBACK_DAYS` | 30 | Price history window in days |
| `NEWS_MAX_AGE_HOURS` | 96 | Maximum article age accepted |
| `NEWS_MAX_ARTICLES` | 300 | Article pool cap before correlation |
| `PRICE_CACHE_TTL` | 90 s | Dashboard price cache lifetime |
| `NEWS_CACHE_TTL` | 300 s | Dashboard news cache lifetime |
| `SCAN_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | 30 | Background scan frequency |
| `MAX_WORKERS` | 4 | Parallel threads for data fetching |
| `RSI_PERIOD` | 14 | RSI calculation window |
| `MOMENTUM_PERIOD` | 10 | Rate-of-change calculation window |
| `DEDUP_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` | 0.65 | Jaccard cutoff for deduplication |
| `PRICE_CHANGE_THRESHOLD` | 2.0 % | Threshold for significant move alert |
| `RELEVANCE_HIGH` | 6 | Score threshold for high-relevance news |
| `RELEVANCE_MEDIUM` | 3 | Score threshold for medium-relevance news |
| `STORAGE_FULL_DETAIL_DAYS` | 7 | Days to retain full snapshots |
| `STORAGE_REDUCED_DETAIL_DAYS` | 30 | Days to retain reduced snapshots |
| `STORAGE_MAX_DAYS` | 60 | Days before snapshot deletion |

### Signal Thresholds

| Label | Score Range |
|---|---|
| Strong Bullish | >= 6.0 |
| Bullish | >= 3.0 |
| Slightly Bullish | >= 1.0 |
| Neutral | -1.0 to 1.0 |
| Slightly Bearish | >= -3.0 |
| Bearish | >= -6.0 |
| Strong Bearish | < -6.0 |

## Signal Interpretation

Signal scores are a compact summary of price action, momentum, sentiment, and context.
Use the ranges below as a quick interpretation guide when scanning assets in the dashboard:

| Score Range | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| +6 to +10 | Strong Bullish |
| +2 to +6 | Bullish |
| -2 to +2 | Neutral |
| -6 to -2 | Bearish |
| -10 to -6 | Strong Bearish |

These ranges are intentionally broad so the label remains readable even as individual
signal components shift over time.

### Per-Asset-Class Signal Weights

| Component | Crypto | Tech Stocks | Commodities | Indices |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trend | 1.2x | 1.2x | 1.3x | 1.5x |
| Momentum | 1.8x | 1.0x | 1.0x | 1.2x |
| RSI | 0.8x | 1.0x | 0.8x | 0.5x |
| Sentiment | 1.2x | 1.6x | 1.2x | 1.0x |
| Trend Strength | 1.2x | 1.0x | 1.0x | 1.2x |
| Context | 0.5x | 1.2x | 1.2x | 1.5x |

---

## Data Storage

Snapshots are stored as gzip-compressed JSON files under `market_data/`:

```
market_data/
  Gold_20260401.json.gz
  Bitcoin_20260401.json.gz
  ...
  _scan_summary.json.gz
```

### Retention Tiers

| Age | Fields Retained |
|---|---|
| 0 – 7 days | Full snapshot including top 5 headlines |
| 8 – 30 days | Reduced: price, change_1d, signal_score, signal_label, trend, rsi, roc_10d, trend_strength |
| > 60 days | Deleted automatically after each scan |

---

## Backtesting

The backtesting module evaluates historical signal accuracy by comparing the signal score on day N with the actual price direction from day N to day N+1.

```python
from app.backtest import evaluate_signal_accuracy
result = evaluate_signal_accuracy("Gold", lookback=20)
print(result["hit_rate"])
```

Results are broken down by:
- Overall hit rate
- Accuracy by signal strength (strong / moderate / weak)
- Accuracy per signal label
- Current win or loss streak

## Roadmap

PulseEngine is being built toward a local-first desktop application — a full-power EXE that runs entirely on your machine with no cloud dependency, no accounts, and no data leaving your device. The Streamlit deployment is a live demo with restricted features.

Planned milestones:
- **v0.3** — Arbitrary ticker support, local installer (repo restructure done in v0.2.1)
- **v0.4** — Desktop EXE via PyInstaller, GitHub Actions build pipeline
- **v0.5** — FinBERT running locally, offline mode, export features
- **v1.0** — Full market coverage, dynamic asset discovery, all stocks

See [Docs/ROADMAP.md](Docs/ROADMAP.md) for the full breakdown including what's out of scope and how to contribute to specific milestones.
